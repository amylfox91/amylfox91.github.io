## Content Sorceress | Historical Researcher | Roving Copywriter

I'm Amy, a seasoned content writer, historical researcher, and copywriter. I specialize in content creation and copy for online businesses, ranging from entertaining and educational YouTube channels to travel and adventure tech startups. With content seen by millions of viewers, and I'm here to elevate your brand's storytelling to new heights.

Originally from New England, I am now located wherever my truck camper takes me! When I’m not brewing new content, you’ll find me dragging my husband to the nearest historic site, cemetery, or scenic overlook.
